    HOW TO ADD A NEW TRAVEL STORY
    ================================================================

    STEP 1: Create the MDX file
    ────────────────────────────
    Copy this template to:  src/content/travel/your-slug-here.mdx
    The filename becomes the URL slug:
      your-slug-here.mdx  →  /travel/your-slug-here

    STEP 2: Fill in the frontmatter above
    ──────────────────────────────────────
    - title:       Display title on the page
    - date:        "YYYY-MM-DD" format (determines sort order)
    - description: Short summary for cards & SEO
    - country:     Country name (shown in stats)
    - distance:    Distance from Dhaka in km (shown in the card)
    - cover:       Cover image URL (1200×800 recommended, Unsplash works great)
    - published:   Set to true when ready (false = hidden from listing)

    STEP 3: Add a matching entry in travel-data.ts
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Open: src/data/travel-data.ts
    Add to the travelLocations array:

    {
      slug: "your-slug-here",              // MUST match filename
      city: "City Name",
      country: "Country",
      coordinates: [LONGITUDE, LATITUDE],   // [lng, lat] — see below
      coverImage: "https://...",            // same as frontmatter cover
      description: "Short description.",
      date: "2026-03-15",                   // same as frontmatter date
      distance: 250,                        // km from Dhaka
    },

    HOW TO FIND LAT/LNG:
    1. Go to Google Maps → right-click on the exact location → Copy coordinates
    2. Google gives: "23.382, 92.293" → that's [latitude, longitude]
    3. In travel-data.ts, coordinates are [LONGITUDE, LATITUDE] → [92.293, 23.382]
    4. Or use: https://www.latlong.net/

    STEP 4: Set published to true
    ─────────────────────────────
    Change "published: false" to "published: true" in the frontmatter.

    That's it! The location will appear on the 3D globe, in the
    tour auto-cycle, on the travel stories slider, and as a blog card.
