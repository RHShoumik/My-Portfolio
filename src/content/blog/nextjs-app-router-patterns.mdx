# Next.js App Router: Patterns That Scale

The App Router in Next.js represents a paradigm shift in how we think about React applications. After building several production apps with it, here are the patterns I rely on.

## Route Group Organization

Route groups `(folder)` let you organize code without affecting URLs:

```
app/
  (marketing)/
    page.tsx          → /
    about/page.tsx    → /about
  (dashboard)/
    layout.tsx        → shared dashboard layout
    settings/page.tsx → /settings
```

## Server Components by Default

The mental model shift: **everything is a server component unless you explicitly opt in** with `"use client"`. This means:

- Data fetching happens on the server
- Bundle size stays small
- Interactivity is intentionally scoped

```tsx
// This component runs on the server — no client-side JS
async function PostList() {
  const posts = await db.post.findMany();
  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map(post => (
        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

## Streaming with Suspense

Wrap slow data fetches in Suspense boundaries for instant page loads:

```tsx
export default function Page() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Dashboard</h1>
      <Suspense fallback={<MetricsSkeleton />}>
        <Metrics />
      </Suspense>
      <Suspense fallback={<ChartSkeleton />}>
        <RevenueChart />
      </Suspense>
    </main>
  );
}
```

These are just the patterns I've found most valuable. The App Router is still evolving, and the ecosystem around it is maturing rapidly.
